# NAMING CONVENTIONS FOR THIS PROJECT

## React Components are named in PascalCase !
## SCSS Modules are named as following: 
    e.g. Component Name: "DashboardModal" -> SCSS Module name: "dashboard_modal.module.scss
    the module needs to be in the same directory as the component (capsulize them)
    then just import it in the Component like: 
        import styles from 'your_module_name.scss'
